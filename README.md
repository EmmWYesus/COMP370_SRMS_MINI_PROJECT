Java based Server Redundancy Management System.
# Server Redundancy Management System
This project is a Java-based Server Redundancy Management System that simulates a simple primaryâ€“backup server setup using object-oriented programming. The system includes a Primary Server that handles client requests, a Backup Server that takes over if the primary fails, a Monitor that checks server status through heartbeats, and a Client that sends requests and automatically switches servers during failover. To run the project, go to the src folder, open Client.java, and run it. You will see heartbeats, failover events, and request logs printed in the console.
